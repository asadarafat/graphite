# Netreplica Graphite
Visualization for Network Topologies

## Supported software

### NetBox

Support for [NetBox](https://netbox.dev/) DCIM system includes:

* Visualization of network topologies exported by [netreplica/nrx](https://github.com/netreplica/nrx) command-line tool
* Does not require installing any plugins on a NexBox instance
* Use of device `role`, plus `site` and/or `tag` information to select devices for visualization
* Customizable topology data definitions via Jinja2 [templates](https://github.com/netreplica/templates/tree/main/graphite)

### Containerlab

Support for [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/) network emulation software includes:

* Visualization of live topologies, including dynamic information about network nodes â€“ for example, management IP addresses.
* WebSSH access to running Containerlab nodes from the topology visualization.
* Launching Graphite as part of Containerlab topology by including it as a node in the topology YAML file.

The easiest way to use Graphite with Containerlab is to add the following code to a topology YAML file under the `nodes:` section. For a full topology example see [examples/2host.yaml](examples/2host.yaml).

```Yaml
    graphite:
      kind: linux
      image: netreplica/graphite
      env:
        HOST_CONNECTION: ${SSH_CONNECTION}
      binds:
        - __clabDir__/topology-data.json:/htdocs/lab/default/topology-data.json:ro
        - __clabDir__/ansible-inventory.yml:/htdocs/lab/default/ansible-inventory.yml:ro
      ports:
        - 8080:80
      exec:
        - sh -c 'graphite_motd.sh 8080'
      labels:
        graph-hide: yes
```

Once added, deploy the topology with `sudo -E containerlab deploy -t <topology.yaml>`. Note `-E` parameter for `sudo` â€“ it is needed to pass `SSH_CONNECTION` variable.

Look for `Graphite visualization ðŸŽ¨ http://<ip_address>:8080/graphite` Containerlab output. If you are running Containerlab on a VM via an SSH session, the `<ip_address>` in the URL should be the one you are using to connect to the VM, so there is a good chance the link will just work. If not, you might need to replace `<ip_address>` with proper address to connect to Graphite.

## Running Graphite as a standalone Docker container

To be able to visualize multiple Containerlab topologies, including those that are not currently running, you can launch Graphite as a standalone container. Follow [the guide](docs/DOCKER.md) to learn how.

## Detailed instructions on installing and using Graphite from source code.

Follow [step-by-step reference](docs/CONTAINERLAB.md) to learn how to use Graphite with ContainerLab from source code.

## NANOG-84 Hackathon

Graphite was conceived as part of [NANOG-84 Hackathon](https://www.nanog.org/events/nanog-84-hackathon/). Here is an original idea:
